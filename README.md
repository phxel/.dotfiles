# My .dotfiles
My daily driver configs. Everything in here is subject to change as I like to mess around with my setup.

# Dependencies
The following packages are required and can be installed through the AUR:

`yay -S hy3 libcava cava`

# Yazi
My Yazi config requires additional plugins that aren't included in these dotfiles. Install them using:

`ya pack -a yazi-rs/plugins:hide-preview`

`ya pack -a yazi-rs/plugins:full-border`
